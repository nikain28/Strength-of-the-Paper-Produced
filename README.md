# High Quality Paper Production Experiment using Factorial Design Analysis

This repository contains code and analysis for an experimental project focusing on producing high-quality paper using factorial design analysis. The project aims to understand the impact of various factors within the paper-making process on the final quality of the paper.

# Objective

The main goal of this project is to utilize factorial design analysis, employing R programming, to comprehensively examine the effects of different factors on paper quality. By studying factors such as hardwood concentration, cooking hours, and pressure used during the wood cooking process, aim to:

1. Investigate interactions between these factors.
2. Conduct hypothesis testing to identify significant factors.
3. Validate hypotheses through main effect and interaction plots.

# Experiment Design
Factorial design experiments allow for the systematic study of multiple factors and their combinations, enabling a comprehensive exploration of interactions. In this project, we conduct a full factorial experiment to thoroughly examine the influence of the chosen factors on paper quality.

# Analysis Process

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Raw data from experiments conducted on various factor combinations is collected and prepared for analysis.
2. Hypothesis Testing: Utilizing statistical methods, hypothesis testing is performed to assess the interaction effects between factors.
3. Visualizations: Main effect plots and interaction plots are generated to visually validate the results obtained from hypothesis testing.
4. Conclusion and Decision Making: Based on the analysis results, a conclusion is drawn regarding the optimal conditions for producing high-quality paper.
